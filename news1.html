				<article>
					<p>Rincewind has been an important character since the Discworld series started. He is a polite yet cowardly wizard with (almost) no magical ability and whose ambition in life is simply to continue having a life. He has been on many adventures, but almost entirely by accident. He is however gifted with languages, speaking several including Chimeran, Vanglemesht, Sumtri, Black Oroogu, High Borogravian and beTrobi. He starred in The Colour of Magic, The Light Fantastic, Sourcery, Eric, Interesting Times and The Last Continent, and was also a major character in the graphic novel, The Last Hero as well as in The Science of Discworld novels. He was born under the "Small Boring Group of Faint Stars", a sign associated with chess board makers, sellers of onions, manufacturers of plastic images of small religious significance and people allergic to pewter. Rincewind became the owner of the Luggage after it was given to him as a present by Twoflower in The Light Fantastic.
