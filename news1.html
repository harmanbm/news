						<h3>Niko Bellic (Serbian: Нико Белић, Niko Belić) is the protagonist of Grand Theft Auto IV and a supporting character in The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony. He is also mentioned by Lester Crest and Patrick McReary in Grand Theft Auto V. The player can choose Niko Bellic as their parent model in Grand Theft Auto Online.
						Niko grew up in Yugoslavia, where he fought in the Yugoslav Wars. He later worked for organized crime syndicates as a hired-gun in Liberty City. Ever since the Yugoslav Wars ended, Niko's main goal in life was to find and kill one of two men: Florian Cravic or Darko Brevic, for one of them betrayed and nearly killed him during the Wars. Niko is the younger cousin of Roman Bellic and the son of Milica Bellic.</h3>

						<h3>This was the first multiplayer that Rockstar Games had properly focused on. You could do literally anything you wanted, no paywalls to unlock anything, no harmless glitches being patched. It was all fun. A lot of people prefer GTA IV’s multiplayer over GTA Online. Everything was available for you in Freemode, you didn’t have to grind to unlock vehicles, you could just find them on the street, lots of amazing game modes, such as Cops n’ Crooks, Turf War, Deathmatch and more. Invite only free modes were also very highly customizable in the settings, selectable vehicles, no police, friendly fire option and much more.</h3>
